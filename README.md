voxlap-orig-refactored
======================

Ken Silverman's Voxlap refactored and updated to work with MSVS 2010 Express with Build and Shoot support.

Consider this a shadow of the voxlap port. Mostly for testing against the voxlap port to isolate problems in the port.

Note to Ericson : My hard disk is making some mighty strange sounds, so I dumped this here just in case. 
It's got no history, but you may find the cmake stuff useful. 

It works fully with SDL + ASM on Windows, but I haven't rebased yet, so be advised.
